## 📂 What I Built

### Core Tasks (01-05)

Progressive assignments covering the Solana development stack:

| Task | Topic | What I Learned |
|:----:|-------|----------------|
| **[01](./task-01/)** | **Intro to Solana & Blockchain** | Blockchain fundamentals, Solana architecture, accounts model, transaction lifecycle |
| **[02](./task-02/)** | **Rust Fundamentals** | Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, structs, enums, error handling |
| **[03](./task-03/)** | **Solana Programming Model I** | Program structure, PDAs, seeds, instruction data, account validation |
| **[04](./task-04/)** | **Solana Programming Model II** | CPIs, system programs, rent exemption, account constraints |
| **[05](./task-05/)** | **Best Practices** | Security patterns, testing strategies, debugging, deployment workflows |

Each task folder contains:
